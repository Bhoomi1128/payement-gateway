            It was of course one of the good early morning of February 1996, till I heard the cry from the neighbor house. I jumped over the boundary wall and got into the house. I could see people sitting and crying at the hall. I looked at the room at the right side of the hall. There was my friend Midhu, hanging on a rope with a knot on his neck. I got frozen for a while and remained frozen emotionally for days
                We used to call him Tarzan. He was physically strong, very intelligent, creative and kind inside. But outside he was an alcohol addict, street fighter and socially unacceptable. He used to share with me about the traumatic childhood had had. The emotional hurts and physical pain that led him to hate his parents, himself and others. I was 16 and Midhu was 22 years of age at that time. His death left a major question on the purpose of my life.
